# Protocol

## Trizol based phase separation

* Handle Trizol and chloroform in the fume hood. 

0. Store cells or tissues by snap freezing in liquid nitrogen to minimize RNA degradation. 
    > You can also store samples in Trizol. 

1. Homogenize in 500ul Trizol (use 27G 1.1/4 needle and 1ml syringe)
    > (!) Thorough homogenization is critical for RNA yield for tissues.<br>
    >     Hard tissues may require grinding them in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle.<br>
    >     Skip syringe homogenization step for cultured cells or already dissociated cells from tissues. Instead pipette up&down several times.

2. Add 100ul of chloroform (20% of original Trizol vol.). Shake vigorously for 15 seconds
 
3. Leave at room temp for 2-3 minutes
 
4. Spin at 4C for 15min
 
5. Transfer aqueous layer to fresh tube.
    > Usually between 2~300uL (supposed to be ~60% of original Trizol vol. but usually less than that especially for tissues).<br><br>
    > (!) From here, you need to worry about RNA degradation by RNases. <br>
    > (!) I don't use DEPC, RNAse Zap, etc. Try to use clean solutions, and try not to chat while working on RNA.<br>
    > (!) It will be safer to assume you have RNase in your solution, and keep things at 4C to minimize RNase activity. 
    

6. Using the aqueous phase, you can either precipitate, or perform additional column based purification. 
    > I get less RNA by going through additional column, but I think I get purer RNA using columns. Subsequent reactions work better after additional column step. 

## Column based purficiation

* You can use any RNA purification columns. 

1. Add equal volume of 70% EtOH
 
2. Transfer up to 700uL of sample to RNeasy Mini spin column. Cfg. 15sec >8000g
 
3. Add 350uL buffer RW1. Cfg. 15sec >8000g.
 
4. Add 500uL buffer RPE. Cfg. 15sec >8000g.
 
5. Add 500uL buffer RPE. Cfg. 15sec >8000g. 
 
6. Place column on a new 2mL tubes. Cfg. at full speed 1min.  
 
7. Place column in a new 1.5mL collection tubes. 30~50uL H2O. Cfg. 1min >8000g.


## check purified RNA yield and quality

1. Use nanodrop to check RNA yield and impurities.
    > Absorbance profiles are good to check impurities. Concentration reliable at >20ng/uL.
    
2. Use Tapestation(Bioanalyzer) to check RNA yield and quality (distinct 18S, 28S peaks).
    > Because RNA signal is concentrated at rRNA peaks, in some ways, the most sensitive. 

3. Use Qubit to check RNA yield.
    > Still reliable even at <20ng/uL.
