<br> before fixation

1. Fix gently disssociated tubules with 4% formaldehyde in PBS at RT for 15 minutes rotating. 
    > I use 16% methanol-free formaldehyde ampoules. Opened ampoules can be stored at 4C by sealing tightly with parafilm. Okay for 1~2 months.<br>
    > I use Falcon Round-Bottom Polypropylene Test Tubes With Cap for fixation (14mL) <br>
    > I noticed tubule structure is not preserved well with <3% formaldehyde with 15 minutes. 

2. Remove formaldehyde. Wash with PBS - 500mM Tris - PBS -PBS.
    > 500mM Tris to quench formaldehyde. Usually okay to skip. <br>
    > Tubules can be stored in PBS at 4C for couple of hours

3. Transfer tubules in 10cm Petri dish. Add permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton-X PBS).
    > Okay to skip. Cells on the outermost layer (spermatogonia, pre-pachytene spermatocytes) are stained well just with 0.05% Triton present in blocking/staining buffers. 

4. Gently dissociate/cut tubules into 2~3mm fragments (>20) with fine forceps and scissors while in permeabilization solution under dissection microscope. 
    > Be gentle so not to disrupt tissue structure. <br>
    > I like to use McPherson-Vannas Micro Scissors, 8 cm Long (KENT SCIENTIFIC CORP, Cat# INS600124) <br>
    > If cut tubule length is too long, they tend to be damaged during pipetting/incubation. <br>
    > Sample tubules from multiple different locations in the testis. <br>
    > You can collect specific stage tubules at this step (https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth1204-249)

5. Transfer tubules to 2mL test tubes using wide-bore tips
    > I use 200µl Univ Wide Bore Tip (GENESEE SCIENTIFIC CORP, Cat# 22-424)

6. Block cells for 30 minutes at RT with >200uL PBST 3% BSA. 
    > Block can be ~10 minutes to overnight (at 4C for O/N)

7. Replace >200uL blocking buffer with 1’ Abs in PBST 3% BSA. Incubate O/N at 4C.
    > Okay to leave for 2~3 nights. For wholemount, usually longer is better.

8. Wash 3~4 times with >1mL PBST for ~10 min per wash at RT.

9. Incubate cells with >200uL 2’ Abs in PBST 3% BSA. Incubate O/N at 4C.
   > Most 2' Abs, use in 1:1000.<br>
   > After adding 2' Abs, keep samples away from light (several minutes fine).<br>
   > 2 hours at RT incubation is also fine. 

10. Wash 3~4 times with >1mL PBST for ~10 min per wash at RT (2nd time /w HOECHST (1:10000).
    > For wholemount, do not use mounting media with DAPI. Nuclei signal is much clearer by staining DNA during wash step. 

11. Mount: use wide bore tips, transfer tubules to slide glass.<br> Arrange tubules not to overlap with each other. Wick PBST away. 
<br> Add 10~20uL mounting media. Put 18x18mm or 22x22mm No.1 or No.1.5 coverslip. Seal with nail polish.

12. Imaging:<br>
    > I use Leica SP5 Confocal, usually with 40X objective. SP5 is not so great, but good enough. <br>
    > I do 2x or 3x line averaging to improve signal-to-noise ratio. <br>
