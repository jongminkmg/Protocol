# Material 
Cells plated or grown on 12mm or 18mm circle No. 1 coverslips.

Fixed w/ 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature.

Last updated: 2. 27. 2021

0. For IF-FISH, you first perform IF, then fix again with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. You can skip the permeabilization step in (1).

1. Incubated w/ permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton-X PBS) for 15min

2. Wash once with PBS

3. Remove RNA by putting the coverslips on drops of 50uL PBS/RNase A (at 0.1mg/mL, 100X) at 37C for 60-90 min
   - 20uL for 12mm coverslips
   - whenever you incubate coverslips on drops, try to remove as much previous buffer as possible.

4. Wash twice in PBS
 
5. Series of EtOH 70%, 90%, 100%, 2min or more each

6. Briefly air dry coverslip
 
7. Put 20 uL of hyb solution (50% formamide, 2X SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 2 ug of mouse Cot1 DNA, 1 uL of paint probe (5pmol), 1uL of secondary Cy3 labeled probe (5pmol)) on slide. 
   - Above is from Hongjae's oligopaint protocol. I used fragmented salmon sperm DNA instead of Cot1 DNA
   - See below for uptodate hyb mix. 
   - Did not add H2O assuming 20% volume will be filled with probes.
   - Carefully mix well. It will require >20 times pipetting up&down with wide end tips.

|Component| for 100uL| for e.g. 300uL|
|---------|----------|---------------|
|formaminde|50uL|150uL|
|20X SSC|   10uL| 30uL|
|50% dextran sulfate| 20uL|60uL|
|Salmon sperm DNA 10ug/uL|   1uL | 3uL|
|H2O     |                    0uL | 0uL|

8. Put coverslip over hyb solution(20uL), cell-side facing down
   - I try to keep the hyb solution at 42C before putting coverslips. Not sure if this mattters.

9. Denature by putting tissue culture plate tops with coverslips on 80C waterbath. 10 minutes. 
   - FISH works better at higher temp (e.g. 94C) but higher temp kills IF signal more efficiently.

10. Incubate at 42C O/N 
    - Incubation temp varies depending on your probe's melting temp.

11. Put 2X SSC on coverslip. Without this, you may not flip over coverslip due to surface tension between culture plate tops and coverslips.
 
12. Put coverslip back to 12 well plate containing 2X SSC 
    - Try to keep 2X SSC at 42C as much as possible. 

13. Wash three times in 2X SSC 
    - second one with DNA staining dye (HOECHST, 1:10000, if it is not SABER FISH)

14. Mount coverslips (SABER-FISH, see 15-17)


### For SABER
15. After wash, incubate for 1 hour at 37C w/ 50uL (for 18mm coverslips) 1uM detection oligo in PBS. 
    - Before incubation, do a last quick PBS wash.

16. Then another 3 times PBS wash (2nd time /w HOECHST)
    - Tried to maintain PBS at 37C during wash as much as possible. 

17. Mount coverslips.
