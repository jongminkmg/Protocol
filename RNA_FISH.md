# Material 
Cells plated or grown on 12mm or 18mm circle No. 1 coverslips. 

Fixed w/ 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. Quench with 100mM Tris, Wash with PBS. 

Purified PER product (probe sets) for target genes.

Last updated: 6. 7. 2022

1. Incubated w/ permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton-X PBS) for 15min.

2. Wash once with PBS.

3. Wash 2X with 2xSSCT (2x SSC, 0.1% Tween-20).

4. Add hybridization solution and denature at 60C for 3min.

|Component| for 100uL| for e.g. 300uL|
|---------|----------|---------------|
|100% formaminde|50uL|150uL|
|20X SSC|   10uL| 30uL|
|50% dextran sulfate| 20uL|60uL|
|20% Tween-20|   1uL | 3uL|
|H2O     |                    0uL | 0uL|

Then I mix 16uL of hyb solution with 4uL PER product.

5. Incubate O/N at 42C

6. Wash 4x with pre warmed SSCT at 60C

7. Rinse once in 1XPBS RT

8. After wash, incubate for 1 hour at 37C w/ 50uL (for 18mm coverslips) 1uM detection oligo in PBS

9. Then another 4 times PBS wash (2nd time /w HOECHST (1:10000))
    > Tried to maintain PBS at 37C during wash as much as possible. 

10. Mount. 
    > 18mm diameter circle: 6.5uL mounting media / 12mm diameter circle: 2.5uL mounting media.
