# Material 
3T3 cells from Emma

Fixed w/ 4% FA

# Protocol 

Incubated w/ permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton-X PBS) for 15min

5. Remove RNA by putting 50uL PBS/RNase A (at 0.1mg/mL, 100X) per well at 37oC for 60-90 min
50uL incubation. Used my RNase A. (~2.5 hours)

6. Wash twice in PBS
 
7. Series of EtOH 70%, 90%, 100%, 2min or more each

8. Briefly air dry coverslip
 
9. Put 20 uL of hyb solution (50% formamide, 2X SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 2 ug of mouse Cot1 DNA, 1 uL of paint probe (5pmol), 1uL of secondary Cy3 labeled probe (5pmol)) on slide. 
I used fragmented salmon sperm DNA instead of Cot1 DNA

formaminde                 50uL -> 150uL
20X SSC                    10uL ->  30uL
50% dextran sulfate        20uL ->  60uL
Salmon sperm DNA 10ug/uL?   1uL ->   3uL
H2O                         0uL (assuming 20% vol. from probes)



10. Put coverslip over hyb solution(20uL), cell-side facing down

11. Seal coverslip with rubber cement Did not dry out without rubber cement.

12. 10min at 94oC on PCR block

- Hybridization chamber pre-incubate in 42C
- S01-S06: standard incubation
  S07-S12: pre-incubate at 41~2C for 10min and then 80C denaturation, then 41~2C

Used 'water bath'. Next time, if the water bath can reach 80C, use the real one.




13. Incubate at 37oC O/N 
Use 41~42C in hyb oven, O/N ~12 hours (set 37C)

14. Take off rubber cement. Do NOT use too much rubber cement to prevent flooding into PCR block.

15. Put 0.5mL of 2X SSC on coverslip. Without this, you may not flip over coverslip due to surface tension between slid and coverslip.
 
16. Put coverslip back to 6 well plate containing 2X SSC 
Tried to wash with 2X SSC at 42C as much as possible. 

17. Wash three times in 2X SSC (second one with DNA staining dye)

18. Mount coverslips


[For SABER]
(*) After wash, incubate for 1 hour at 37C w/ 1uM detection oligo in PBS. 

(*) Then another 3 times PBS wash (2nd time /w HOECHST)
Tried to maintain PBS at 37 during wash as much as possible. 

(*) Then mount.
