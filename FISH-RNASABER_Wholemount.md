# Material 
Freshly fixed seminiferous tubules. 

Purified PER product (probe sets) for target genes.

Last updated: 3. 29. 2021

1. Fix gently dissociated tubules with 4% formaldehyde in PBS at RT for 15 minutes rotating.

2. Remove formaldehyde. Wash with PBS - 500mM Tris - PBS -PBS.
   - Tubules can be stored in PBS at 4C for couple of hours

3. Transfer tubules in 60mm dish. Add permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton-X PBS).

4. Gently dissociate/cut tubules into 2~3mm fragments (>20) while in permeabilization solution. 
   - Be gentle so not to disrupt tissue structure. 
   - If cut tubule length is too long, they tend to get damaged while pipetting. 
   - Sample tubules from multiple different locations in the testis.
   - (Insert a picture here)

5. Wash twice with 2xSSCT (2x SSC, 0.1% Tween-20)

6. Add hybridization solution and denature at 60C for 3min.

|Component| for 100uL| for e.g. 300uL|
|---------|----------|---------------|
|100% formaminde|50uL|150uL|
|20X SSC|   10uL| 30uL|
|50% dextran sulfate| 20uL|60uL|
|20% Tween-20|   1uL | 3uL|
|H2O     |                    0uL | 0uL|

Then I mix 80uL of hyb solution with 20uL PER product.

7. Incubate O/N at 42C

8. Wash 4x with pre warmed SSCT at 60C

9. Rinse once in 1XPBS RT

10. Add Fluor (1uM) hyb. solution and incubate at 37C for 1 hour

11. Then another 4 times PBS wash (2nd time /w HOECHST (1:10000))
    - Tried to maintain PBS at 37C during wash as much as possible. 
    - Tubules tend to stick to the tube walls. Add a bit of PBST helps. 

12. Mount. 
    - Will need more than usual mounting media (>30uL) for 12mm x 12mm coveslips, because tubules don't get squashed after hyb solution incubation (dehydrated).
