  - Protein A for rabbit antibodies. Protein G for mouse. 

# Crosslinking protein A magnetic beads to primary antibodies
  > Usually people do IP w/o crosslinking. So probably okay crosslinking steps. 

[Conjugate antibodies to magnetic beads]
[below example for 4 IPs]

1. Take 200uL Protein A dynabeads (30uL/IP and 20uL/preclear) x 4 IPs
> mix beads well before taking an aliquot
 
2. Use a magnet to attract beads and remove the supernatant 
 
3. Immediately replace liquid (before beads dry) with 500uL 3% BSA in PBSt (0.1% tween) 
> Mix 300mg BSA in 10mL PBSt
 
4. Magnet, aspirate and wash with another 500uL 3% BSA in PBSt
 
5. Magnet, aspirate and resuspend beads in 500uL 3% BSA in PBSt
 
6. Separate into 2 tubes and label: ‘Beads+Ab’ (300uL) or ‘Preclear’ (200uL). 
 
7. Aspirate the ‘Beads+Ab’ tube, and add 800uL lysis buffer (omit protease inhibitors). 
(20uL 1M Tris (20mM)+ 27uL 5M NaCl (135mM) +100uL 100% glycerol (10%) 
+100uL 10% Igepal (1%) +20uL .5M EDTA + 733 water)
 
8. Add antibodies 
e.g.)
400uL – 2uL (0.2-1ug) of CHD4 (ab72418, Abcam) antibody
400uL – 2uL (1ug)        of IgG  (from Behfar) antibody
> Amount of antibody used is empirical. 
> I use 2mL round bottom tubes for better mixing.

9. Incubate at RT for 1 hour on a rotator for antibodies to bind protein A/G
 
10. Remove supernatant
 
> *Below step is to crosslink antibodies to the beads. This step is helpful if you do not want antibodies eluted with immunoprecipitated material. 

11. Add 1mL 0.2M triethanolamine pH 8.2 
(580uL of 6.7M triethanolamine into 17mL water, pH with ~150uL 1N HCL, bring final volume to 20mL)
or (1.16mL Triethanolamine, 35mL H2O, pH w/ 1N HCl (3200uL total), bring to final vol. of 40mL)
 
> Note: Triethanolamine (T58300) - 1.124g/mL, 149.19g/mol, so 7.5M
0.2mols / L = 0.02mols/100mL
2.98g/100mL
 
12. Repeat triethanolamine wash x2 (5 min. each wash)
 
13. Add 1mL dimethylprimelimidate (DMP) to beads (5.4mg DMP into 1mL 0.2M triethanolamine)
> I save DMP aliquots in 5mL tubes, sealed with parafilm in 4C. 5mL tubes are stored in a sealed container with dessicants.  

14. Incubate at RT for 30min. on a rotator
 
15. Discard supernatant
 
16. Add 1mL 50mM Tris, pH 7.5, wash 15min with mixing
> Tris to quench unreacted fixatives.
> You will notice beads becoming ‘clumpy’ as the solution does not have detergents.

17. Discard supernatant
 
18. Wash 3x with 1mL PBSt
 
19. Resuspend ‘Beads+Ab’ in 200uL PBSt, store at 4C.
> You can prepare crosslinked antibodies overnight. 
  
[Immunoprecipitation]
 
> Making a good lysate (solubilizing your protein of interest) is the crucial step. It can be a balancing act of detergents, salt concentration, and physical force (homogenization, sonication, freeze-thaw) to maintain protein-protein interaction while breaking up cellular components for solubilization. 

20. Methods for homogenization.
    - Cell pellets, embryos, or very soft tissues will be readily dissolved
    - Soft tissues, you can try homogenizing using blue pestles (fitting 1.7mL test tubes) or going through successive 22G->25G needles (up&down about 10 times).<br>
      Instead of needles, you can also use a 1mL sized Dounce homogenizer.
    - Hard tissues, first grinding in LN2 and then homogenizing, work the best for me.

21. Add lysis buffer.
    - 30-50uL per 1mg tissue (1mg/30-50uL = 20-33ug/uL range. But since it's not' dry protein weight', actual conc. will be far lower) 
    - 10-25uL per 1M cells (assuming 50ug total protein/1M cells, to get 2-5ug/uL range lysate)
> Lyse first try with 1mL of lysis buffer per testis

22. Homogenize with your favorite method.
> Mechanically disrupt testis with a syringe (1mL syringe and a 21/23/25G sequential needles)
 
23. Incubate lysate at 4C for 30 minutes on a rotator.
> Not sure if this step is absolutely necessary. 
 
24. Spin the lysates down at max speed for 10 minutes at 4C. Take supernatant. 
> If you are making lysates for the first time, do not throw away pellets. Check with Western later to see if you are not losing your protein in the pellet. 

26. Measure concentration using Bradford Assay (Blank, 5, 10, 15, 20). Use 1~2uL. 
 
27. Take out ~5ul (~30ug lysate, ~2% of IP) of lysate for Western. (INPUT). Freeze.
 
28. Preclear the cell lysate: Add lysates to the washed beads (w/o Ab), and incubate on the rotator for 30min @ 4C.

29. Block the antibody-conjugated beads in 3% BSA PBSt for 30 min @ 4C. 
 
30. Using magnet, remove the supernatant from antibody-conjugated beads.
 
31. Take pre-cleared lysates after magnet separation.
 
32. Add lysates to the blocked antibody-conjugated beads and incubate for 4 hrs to O/N on rotator @ 4C

 
Post incubation:
33. Turn heat block to 70C, turn another heat block to 100C 
 
34. Using magnet, collect supernatant. Save as 'flow through' for Western blot later. 
 
35. Immediately replace the depleted supernatant with 1mL cold lysis buffer and incubate beads on rotator for 5 min @ 4C
Wash with lysis buffer.
 
36. Repeat wash 2x with 1mL lysis buffer wash (don’t spin between washes, use magnet!)
 
37. Resuspend dynabeads in 100uL lysis buffer and transfer to new tube.
> This step is supposedly not to collect contaminants sticked to the tubes. Not sure if this is that helpful. 
 
38. Add 15~50 uL fresh elution buffer to the Dynabeads (made fresh + protease inhibitors) 
 
39. Vortex lightly briefly. 
 
40. Incubate bead in elution buffer @ 70C for 30 min. with frequent (every 5 min) vortexing. 
 
41. Spin tubes at RT for 10 seconds to take evaporated liquid down. 
 
42. Hold beads in place with magnet and transfer all the supernatant to a new tube. 

 
TCA precipitation :
 
1. Add 50uL of TCA to 200uL eluate (20% TCA final)
 
2. mix and incubate >1hr in 4C.
 
3. 14K 15min spin
 
4. -20C acetone wash (1mL) (– leave on ice 5min before cfg.)
 
5. remove acetone, dry, resuspend in 13uL 1X western loading buffer.
