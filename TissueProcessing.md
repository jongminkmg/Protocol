# Protocol

## Making lysates

1. Dissect testes in cold PBS, clean fat off testes	

2. Fix testes in either 4% formaldehyde in PBS at 4C or Bouins fixative at room temperature overnight (on rocker or rotator)
    > Try to have >10X volume of fixatives than the tissue. <br>
    > I use ~10mL of fixatives in the round bottom tube (to preven testes stuck at the V-shaped bottom)	

3. After overnight fixation, breadloaf testes (cut testis in 1/2) and fix several more hours	

4. Wash testis 3x 20min in H2O
    > It is okay ~2x 10min wash

5. Wash and dehydrate testis in EtOH gradient:
    - Wash RT, 2hr 30% EtOH
    - Wash RT, 2hr 50% EtOH
    - Wash RT, 2+hrs 70% EtOH
    > 30%, 50% EtOH wash can be 0.5~4hours as long as testes goes into 70% EtOH at the end of the day.


6. Continue to change 70% EtOH until solution and testes are no longer yellow 	
    > this is for bouins fixative only, tissue fixed in 10% formalin does not need to be washed multiple days

7. Place testes in 2mL tubes and send out for paraffin embedding and sectioning	
    > (!) Use EtOH-resistant pen
