# Material 
- Freshly dissociated single cells in PBS
- Zombie Green Fixable Viability Kit (BIOLEGEND INC, 423111)
- 10% BSA in PBS frozen aliquots
- Cold PBS, Cold PBS + 2mM EDTA

# Protocol 

Last updated: 3. 1. 2021

1. Cfg. 400G, 6min

2. Resuspend Zombie Green in PBS (1uL ZG / 1mL PBS). Incubate at RT for ~20 min.
   - About ~10 million cells / 1mL ZG+PBS range

3. Wash by directly adding ~40mL PBS + 0.5% BSA
   - BSA to 'quench' zombie green.

4. Cfg. 400G, 6min
Â 
5. Resuspend in (x) mL with each antibody dissolved in PBS EDTA + ~0.1% BSA. Incubate at 4C for ~30min.
   - About ~10 million cells / 1mL antibody solution

6. Wash by directly adding cold PBS EDTA up to 50mL

7. Cfg. 400G, 6min

8. Resuspend with cold PBS EDTA 0.1% BSA. To have ~10million/mL cells.

9. Analyze or sort.

### Note for sorting. 

- Pre-coat all plastic surface with ~0.1% BSA PBS to prevent cell loss.
- Do not use PBS with EDTA for sorted cell collection as EDTA can prevent cell attachment to coverslips.
