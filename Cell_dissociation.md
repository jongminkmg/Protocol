Last updated: 5. 18. 2023

0. Pre-warm collagenase and trypsin solutions at 37C. 
    > I do this in a hybridization oven.

1. Remove tunica membranes with fine forceps<br>

2. Dissociate tubules in cold PBS like below <br>
![Tubules before digestion](https://github.com/jongminkmg/Storage/blob/main/Pre-fix_tubules.jpg?raw=true "Tubules before digestions")
    > before digestion (doesn't have to be this well-separated)

3. Transfer tubules (from two testes from one adult animal) to 2mL tubes with 1.5mL of collagenase.

4. Incubate while slowly rotating the tubes for 10 minutes. 

5. Further dissociate tubules by up&down 15 times with 1mL tips. 
    > Tubules loosened up a bit by the prior 10 minutes of incubation, so you should be able to easily dissociate them. 

6. Let tubule fragments sink. Remove supernatant with interstitial cells. Transfer tubule fragments to 50mL tubes. 

7. Add fresh 5mL collagenase. Up&down 15 times. Incubate 10 more minutes at 37C with occasional stirring and up&down with 1mL pipette tips. 

8. Cfg at 300G 3 minutes. Remove supernatant. 
    > I just pour down supernatant immediately after cfg. <br>
    > (as opposed to vacuum-suction or using pipette-mans.) 

9. Add 10mL Trypisin solution. Up&Down 15 times. Incubate 10 more minutes at 37C with occasional stirring and up&down with 1mL pipette tips. 
    > Most protocols have DNase I at this stage to prevent clumping. <br>
    > I do not use DNase I, so a big clump will be formed after adding Trypsin. <br>
    > Somehow I get 'cleaner' cell preps, as it seemed like a lot of junks are removed with the 'clump'. 

10. Prepare a new 50mL tubes with 40uL cell strainers. Pour trypsinized cell solutions into the new 50mL tubes with strainers. 
    > (!) Do 10 times up&down right before pouring into cell strainers. Important for the yield. 

11. Add 3 vol. (30mL) of cold DMEM+FBS to quench Trypsin. Mix by rotating the tubes a few times.

12. Cfg. 400G for 6 min. Discard supernatant. 

13. Resuspend loosened cell pellets with 10mL of cold DMEM+FBS to quench Trypsin completely. Also, take 10uL to count cell numbers. 
    > Cell viability seemed to be worse w/o this additional DMEM FBS step, but I did not do side-by-side comparisons. 

14. Cfg. 400G for 6min. Discard supernatant. 

15. Use cells for downstream applications. 
    > Note at this stage, cells are covered with FBS, and that can affect your downstream applications. <br>
    > (e.g., if you do Western with these cells, a significant proportion (>20%) of your protein prep will be albumin. <br>
