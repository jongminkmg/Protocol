# Material 
  - Cells plated or grown on 12mm or 18mm circle No. 1 (or 1.5) coverslips. <br>(cells can be cultured on coverslips or suspension/dissociated cells can be attached by cfg. on Poly-D-Lysine coated coverslips)

  - PBST (PBS + 0.05% Triton-X 100)

  - PBST BSA (PBST + 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA))

# Protocol 

Last updated: 4. 13. 2021

0. Cell prep
   - **(When culture)**<br>
     Seed 100K cells per well on 18mm circle coverslips in 12 wells<br><br>
   - **(When attaching dissociated cells)**<br>
     1) Incubate coverslips on a drop of <100uL (for 18mm circles) Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) minimum 20 minutes.<br>
     2) Put PDL-coated coverlips in 12-well (18mm) or 24-well (12mm) plates, and wash once with PBS.<br>
     3) Add dissociated cells into wells (100~300K cells for 12mm) . Cfg. at 80G for 1min. Fix immediately. 
        > (!) Make sure coverlips sank at the bottom before adding cells.<br>
        > (!) Try to use wells in the center if possible. 
     
1. Fix with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at RT. 
   > I use 16% methanol-free formaldehyde ampoules. Opened ampoules can be stored at 4C by sealing tightly with parafilm. Okay for 1~2 months.
  
2. Wash once with PBS

3. Wash w/ PBS -> w/ 500mM Tris (leave ~5 min) -> w/ PBS.
   > 500mM Tris to quench formaldehyde. Usually okay to skip.  

4. Permeabilize with PBS with 0.2% Triton-X for 15 minutes.
   > Usually okay to skip. 0.05% Triton-X in antibody incubation steps sufficient to permeabilize for the most part. 

5. Block cells for 30 minutes at RT with PBST 3% BSA. 
   > Make 60uL drops of blocking solution on the culture plate lid. Put coverslips cell facing down. (for 18mm coverslips, 30uL for 12mm).<br>
   > Block can be ~10 minutes to overnight (at 4C for O/N)
 
6. Replace blocking buffer with 1’ Abs in PBST 3% BSA. Incubate O/N at 4C.
   > Okay to leave for 2~3 nights. 

7. Wash 3~4 times with PBST for ~10 min per wash at RT.

8. Incubate cells with 2’ Abs in PBST 3% BSA. Incubate O/N at 4C.
   > Most 2' Abs, use in 1:1000.<br>
   > After adding 2' Abs, keep coverslips away from light (several minutes fine).<br>
   > 2 hours at RT incubation is also fine. 

9. Wash 3~4 times with PBST for 10 min per wash at RT.
    
10. Quick rinse with dH2O
 
11. Mount coverslips on Vectashield(mounting media) containing DAPI. Then seal with nail polish.
    > 18mm diameter circle: 6.5uL mounting media / 12mm diameter circle: 2.5uL mounting media
